# khanaKhojo
 
KhanaKhojo is a web based search food application. In this, we can suggest food according to the BMI, trending(famous) foods from that locality, famous food according to the festival in that area which will help an individual to choose his/her food. The problem we are here to tackle is sometimes it is hard for an individual to decide the food especially when he/she is a tourist or a student residing in any PG or hostel or someone which has moved to a new city. This application tries to minimize the time wasted in deciding the food.
